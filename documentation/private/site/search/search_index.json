To configure them you can use Raspberry Pi Imager app, following the instructions of this document, https://bricolabs.cc/wiki/guias/guiadeinicioraspberrypi2021 . Make sure you put a different hostname for every raspberry, so that later you can distinguish them.</p> </li> <li> <p>After that, you will connect your raspberries to current.

Once you select one of them, on the upper right part, you will see its current speed. With the scrolling bar you can set the speed you want for the fan. Once set, click on the Update button to send the speed to the fan. The fan will automatically start spinning at that speed and on the SPEED SCHEMA you will see a change in its circle dimension (depending on the new speed). To stop all the fans, click on the Stop All button.</li> <li>By a functionality file: If you don\u2019t want to manually set every fan you can also use a functionality file. The file must me a .xlsx. The first column is the for the time and the next columns are for the fans speed. You have some examples on the software/functionalities folder. To use it, click on the Add Functionality Button on the window. Drag and drop the file. Once added you will see its name below. Now you have two options:<ul> <li>Real execution: If you click on execute preview the fans will receive their new speeds and the functionality will execute in real time. To stop it you can click on Stop Execution. During this execution, the manual fan control will be disabled.</li> <li>Preview execution: If you click on Execute Preview the fans will not change. A window like SPEED SCHEMA will open, and there you will be able to see what will happen to the fans if you execute the functionality. To close it just close the window.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Apart from this, you can also click on Show Pressure to see the pressure values on real time on a window. For this, you will need and specific pressure sensor. The first time you open it you will have to introduce its IP address and its port number.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before closing the program don\u2019t forget to Stop All the fans.
