# JavaFAWT
JavaFAWT is a fan-array-wind tunnel (FAWT) open-source software and hardware architecture developed by the drones lab of Universidad PÃºblica de Navarra. It includes diagrams and PCB layouts for electronics, CAD designs for hardware, and source files for running and adapting the software. 
## Introduction
### Features
* Modular low-cost FAWT architecture.
* Individual or multiple fan speed control through a simple unified interface.
* Websockets protocol implemented for wireless communication with each fan module.

## How to install & run
Detailed instructions for installing and running the software can be found [here](https://github.com/UPNAdrone/JavaFAWT/blob/main/documentation/private/docs/installation.md).
